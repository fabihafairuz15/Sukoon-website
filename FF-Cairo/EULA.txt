2Definitions

Wherever used in this EULA the meaning shall be the following:

Within your organization
“Within your organization” shall mean usage inside your company or organization, across all your business locations, but shall not include usage by clients or other third parties, including self-employed parties who are working for you but not at one of your business locations. Self- employed third parties temporarily working at one of your business locations on your devices are considered part of your organization.

On servers under your control
“On servers under your control” shall mean that all fonts are solely stored using online storage (hereafter servers) to serve websites for which you or your organization have sole administrative access to (aside from the owner of the server).

Visitors per month
“Visitors per month” shall mean the number of uniquely identifiable users visiting your websites. You have to record and control the number of monthly visitors by using an analytics tool generally recognized to be able to document the number of unique visitors to a website. You have to purchase a licensing upgrade if you exceed your monthly visitors limit at any point in order to cover that larger number of monthly visitors. Format Foundry reserves the right to request and receive screenshots of your analytics tool to prove that the amount of unique visitors per month is below the maximum limit of allowed visitors you have purchased licenses for.

Embed
“Embed” shall both mean the use of fonts in applications, meaning the embedding of the font files through various means (depending on the operating system and programming platform) into the application or an application package. The fonts are used by said application to style dynamic or static text inside those applications. You must neither embed the fonts into any physical devices directly nor save font files onto a device and sell, gift, ship, in any other way hand that device to any third party.

Applications
“Applications” shall mean applications able to run and function on one of the following operating system platforms, on versions that are less than 3 years old: Microsoft Windows, Apple MacOS, Apple iOS, Android, insofar as they support the font files as they are supplied by Format Foundry. Other operating systems are also covered under this agreement if they support the font files as they are supplied by Format Foundry, but Format Foundry can not offer any technical support.

Licensing add-ons/Extended
“Licensing add-ons” shall mean further licensing types, defined in add-ons to this agreement, that can be purchased in addition to the Desktop, Web, and App licensing.

If you need to extend your license for special use, please contact us. Describe your project and how you plan to use the fonts and we’ll help you understand whether special licensing is required and if so, the cost and next steps.

For Web licensing, the following terms apply: 4.1 Usage rights

You are purchasing a certain amount of licenses to use fonts by Format Foundry on web servers under your control, and under control of a single organization, to serve a specific number of website visitors per month. You are purchasing so-called self-hosted fonts that you host on your own servers.

Installations
For each license you purchase, you may install the fonts on any number of hosting services for any number of domains, as long as the overall number of monthly unique visitors of all websites served from those servers and domains added up is smaller than the number you have purchased licenses for and all those installations are within your organization.

The number of allowed unique visitors is noted during your purchase and on your invoice.

File handling
The use of the fonts on devices in your organization is restricted to preparing their use on servers, for activities generally called “web development”.A copy of the fonts may be sent to a third-party website developer if necessary. The fonts may be embedded into websites using the CSS @font-face technique or similar. The fonts may not be embedded into any other format or in any other way under this license.

You must not use the fonts to create or save raster, texture or vector images.

Modification
You may not modify the fonts under any circumstance, except by subsetting the character set of the fonts, meaning using an application or service to reduce the number of characters or features in the font while not modifying any of the underlying character designs (also known as the design of the typeface) or font name tables. You may not, under any circumstances, modify the design of the typeface or its font name tables. Any rights, including but not limited to copyrights and trademarks, of both the original version and the edited version remains with Format Foundry and their respective owners, and the number of unique website visitors covered by the license remains the same overall. Outside of their legal use as described in this license, you may not distribute, lend, rent, sell, give away, publicly or privately share any modified or unmodified version of the fonts. Format Foundry does not offer any support for or guarantee the proper functioning of any modified fonts.

5App Licensing

‘App-Font’ or ‘Font’ is defined as the design of the Font and the Software that produces a typeface design.

App fonts are licensed on the basis of how many users install your app. Licensing starts at 500 app installations up to 500,000 installations. If you exceed your already purchased installations, you can come back to buy more.

You are purchasing a license to use fonts by Format Foundry in an application. If you exceed the number of app installations, you may need to purchase additional, per-download licenses.

Installations
The number of developers who may use the fonts for development of the application depends on the amount of licenses purchased, as referenced during your purchase and on your invoice. You may not install the fonts on any further devices or use them by further developers, aside from archival copies.The use of the fonts on devices in your organization is restricted to preparing their use in applications, for activities generally called “application development”. The fonts may not be used aside from the fonts’ use as embedded fonts in your applications.

File handling
A copy of the fonts may be sent to a third-party app developer if necessary, and these developers count towards your licensed number of developers. The fonts may not be embedded into any other format or in any other way under this license. Embedding of the font with the CSS @font-face technology is expressly prohibited, also creating what is commonly known as «virtual terminals». Embedding of the font into computer files other than application files (for example document formats like PDF, EPS, and PS) is expressly prohibited. You must not use the fonts to create or save raster, textures or vector images or documents in your applications.

Modification
You must not modify the fonts under any circumstance.

Licensing beyond what’s on our site
Our desktop, webfont and mobile app licenses are tailored to meet the majority of our customer’s needs, but we understand there are scenarios beyond these three.

Webfont licenses almost always limit the number of page views (whether on a cumulative or monthly basis) allowed, and digital ads licenses typically restrict the number of ad impressions that may be generated.
